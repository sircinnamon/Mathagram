A (single) Mathagram is a puzzle of the form

# 1xx + xxx + 468

where the x's must be filled in with a digit from 1-9 with no repeat digits appeating in the equation

a double mathagram has the form

# xxx + xxx + 5x3 + 123 = xxx + 795

where each digit from 1-9 appears exactly twice

There are also triple mathagrams following the same pattern.
